In order to manage iptables via systemd utilities, you will need to install (if it is not already installed) the iptables-services package using the following command:

yum update && yum install iptables-services
Now, you can stop and disable firewalld using the following commands:

systemctl stop firewalld.service
systemctl disable firewalld.service
Next, enable iptables to both initialize on boot and start during the current session:

systemctl enable iptables.service
systemctl start iptables.service
